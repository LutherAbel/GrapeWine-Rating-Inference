# Grape Wine Rating Inference
This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to **identify widely acclaimed wines** using market-available features, overcoming the limitations of complex, lab-based prediction methods. The core objective is to provide a predictive model that assists three key stakeholders: **consumers** making purchasing decisions, **wine cellar owners** selecting inventory to import, and **winery owners** understanding general public preferences.
